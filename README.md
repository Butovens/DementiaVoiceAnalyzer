## Overview 
This project, based on the 2021 Address Challenge, focuses on detecting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) through speech and language analysis. While memory loss is often associated with AD, changes in language patterns also provide important clinical insights. Our approach utilizes machine learning methods to identify subtle signs of AD in speech data, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for early detection and intervention.
